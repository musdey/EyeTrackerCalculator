EyeTrackerCalculator

This is a simple calculator which works with the Tobii Eyetracker. 

The input is a simple gaze on the panels. The gaze is indicated via progressbars. 

The whole input is written down in a string and finally calculated with NCalc.




Feel free to use this application, which was developed during the class Interactive Technologies @FH Hagenberg
